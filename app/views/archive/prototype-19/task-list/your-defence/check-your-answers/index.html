        Mary Richards and I signed a contract for building works on our roof. The work on the roof was completed but there was a problem with one section. I asked Mary Richards to get the problem fixed, but hadn't had a reply.

I'll have to get another builder to rectify the problem which will cost me £1,500.

Therefore, I'm making a money claim for £1,500 to compensate for the extra money I am going to need to spend.
