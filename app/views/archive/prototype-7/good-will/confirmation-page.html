      <h2 class="heading-medium">What happens next</h2>
      <p>Your claim will continue to a hearing. You'll need to prepare evidence and pay hearing fee.</p>
      <p>We'll send you a hearing date by email and SMS, and we'll explain what to do.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">What you can do</h2>
      <p>You can still contact Mary Richards directly while your claim progresses.</p>
      <p>Many people are able to settle their claim by discussing what's gone wrong. If you can make an agreement you
        won't need to go to a hearing.</p>
