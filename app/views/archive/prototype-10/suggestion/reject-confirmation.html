        <p>We've emailed Mary Richards your response.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">What happens next</h2>
        <p>Mary Richards will submit a defence to the claim by 15 March. The case will be reviewed by a judge and might go to a
          hearing. <br><br>You'll need to prepare a full case, wait for a hearing date and pay hearing fee.</p>
        <p>We'll send you a hearing date by email and SMS, and we'll explain what to do.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">What you can do</h2>
        <p>You can still contact Mary Richards directly while your claim progresses.</p>
        <p>Many people are able to settle their claim by discussing what's gone wrong. If you can make an agreement you
          won't need to go to a hearing.</p>
