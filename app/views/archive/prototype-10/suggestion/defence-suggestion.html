        Mary Richards' response
      </h1>

      <p class="panel panel-border-wide">
        Mary Richards has submitted a defence. However, they'd like to avoid going to court and have made a suggestion
        for you to consider, as way to settle the claim.
      </p>

      <div class="heading-small">Mary Richards' defence:</div>
      <p>The work on the roof was completed as per the contract.</p>

      <p>Jan says she contacted me but I didn't get a call or an email - I'd have been happy to take a look at the roof
        and see if there was a problem. There shouldn't be a need to get someone else in and the quote of £1,500 sounds
        high.</p>

      <!--<p>We've worked in the roofing trade for 20+ years and have a really good reputation. We're members of the-->
        <!--National Federation of Roofing Contractors and always pride ourselves on excellent customer service. We believe-->
        <!--our work is of a high standard and we were not contacted by the customer about the problem to which this claim-->
        <!--relates.</p>-->

      <br>

      <div class="heading-small">Their suggestion</div>
      <p>I will fix the roof if you'll give me access and pay for any extra materials.</p>

      <!--<p>I'd be happy to come an inspect the roof again and see what we can do. If there is a problem still we will sort-->
      <!--it out for you. However, as discussed before, this might mean putting in place an additional support for the-->
      <!--roof at a materials cost of £50. Would you be willing to cover that materials cost if we carry out the work for-->
      <!--no extra fee?</p>-->
