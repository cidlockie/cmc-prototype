      <p>I understand that you're not happy with the work on the roof. I'd really like to get this sorted out. The last thing I want is to go to court over this.</p>

      <div class="heading-small">Their suggestion</div>
      <p>I'd be happy to come an inspect the roof again and see what we can do. If there is a problem still we will sort it out for you. However, as discussed before, this might mean putting in place an additional support for the roof at a materials cost
        of £50. Would you be willing to cover that materials cost if we carry out the work for no extra fee?</p>
