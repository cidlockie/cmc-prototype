      <p>Jan Clark has made a money claim against you.</p>

       <p class="panel panel-border-wide">You have until <strong class="bold"><span id="Date"></span></strong> to respond to this
        claim.</p>

      <p class="heading-medium">Claim details</p>
      <p class=""><span class="bold">Reference:</span> CF91-BK65</p>
      <p class=""><span class="bold">Amount:</span> £1,500</p>


      <p class="bold">Reason for claim:</p>

      <p>Mary Richards and I signed a contract for building works on my roof. The work on the roof was completed but
        there was a problem with one section. I asked Mary Richards to get the problem fixed, but didn't get a
        reply.</p> <p>I'll have to get another builder to rectify the problem which will cost me £1,500.</P> <p>Therefore, I'm making a money
        claim for £1,500 to compensate for the extra money I'm going to need to spend.</p>

      <p>The problem with the roof has caused me a lot of stress. We've been planning to put the house on the market so wanted this work completed. We've had to hold off listing the house with an agent until this is sorted out.</p>
