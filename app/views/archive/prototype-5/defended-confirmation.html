                    <p>I accept that there was initially a problem with the work we did on the roof. However after inspecting it we offered to fix it at no extra cost. <br>

                        <br>We completed the fix and I wasn't aware the problem had recurred.<br>

                        <br> I'd like to get this sorted out so I'd be happy to take another look and to discuss whether any further work is needed. </p>

                <p>The case will be reviewed by a judge and might go to a hearing. We'll contact you when a hearing is scheduled and explain what to do.</p>
                <p>You can still contact Jan Clark anytime to reach an agreement before a hearing.</p>
