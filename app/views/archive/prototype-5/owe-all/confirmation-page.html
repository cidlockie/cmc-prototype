            <h2 class="heading-medium">What happens next</h2>
            <p>Jan Clark has 5 days to respond. They can accept your plan, reject it, or suggest an alternative. We'll update you by email and SMS if this happens.</p>

            <p>If your plan is rejected, or there is no response, the court will decide how you pay the money.</p>

            <p class="panel panel-border-wide">
                If your plan is accepted but you don't keep up repayments, Jan Clark can restart the claim.
