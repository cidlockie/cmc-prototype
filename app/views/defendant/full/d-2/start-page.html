          Respond to a  money claim
        </h1>

        <p>You need to respond to the money claim within 14 days of receiving the claim.</p>

        <p>Your response will be sent to the claimant (the person or organisation who says you owe them money). The claimant can apply for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt">County Court Judgment (CCJ)</a> against you if you don't respond in time. They can then use this to get the money from you. For example, they could hire bailiffs.</p>

        <p>A CCJ may make it harder to get credit, such as a mobile phone contract, credit card or mortgage.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-small">If you think you’re owed money</h3>
      <p>If you believe the claimant owes you money you can make a claim against them (‘counterclaim’). You can do this as part of your response to the claim against you.</a>

        <h3 class="heading-small">If you can't afford to pay the money back</h3>
        <p>You might be able to get free legal advice about dealing with debt from organisations like <a href="https://www.stepchange.org/">StepChange</a>. Do this after you finish responding to the claim against you.</p>
