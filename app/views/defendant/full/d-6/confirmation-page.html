    <h2 class="heading-medium">What to do if you get paid</h2 >

      <p>Tell the defendant when you’ve received their payment.</p>
      <p>You must also tell the court what date you were paid or accepted an offer. Do this by emailing moneyclaims@hmcts.gsi.gov.uk</p>
      <h3 class="heading-medium">Your money claims account</h3>

      <h2 class="heading-medium"> If you disagree with the response</h2>

          <li>the defendant says they don’t owe you any money</li>

          <li>you don’t agree with how they’ve offered to repay you</li>
        </uL>
        <p>The court may send you a questionnaire asking for more information on the case.</p>
        <h2 class="heading-medium">What you can do</h2>
        <p>You can still contact {% if data.counterclaim=="true" %}Mary Richards{%else%}Jan Clark{% endif %} directly while your claim progresses. Many people are able to settle their
          claim by discussing what's gone wrong. If you can make an agreement you won't need to go to a hearing.</p>
