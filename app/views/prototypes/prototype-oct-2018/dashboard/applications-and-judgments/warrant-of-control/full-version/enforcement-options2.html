            <p>There are differences between a writ and a warrant. You must pay a fee for whichever you choose. If you choose to apply for both you will have to pay two fees.</p>

            <strong class="bold-small">Apply for a warrant of control</strong>
          </p>
          <p>A warrant of control instructs a county court enforcement officer, known as a bailiff, to visit the defendant to try to get your money. They have fewer powers than bailiffs that enforce a writ of control, but you won't have to pay an extra fee to cover their costs if they're not able to collect the debt.</p>
            <p>You can only apply for a warrant of control online for a debt of less than £5,000, including both:</p>

          <p>If you apply for a writ of control, a high court enforcement officer will visit the defendant to try to get your money.</p>
          <p>High court enforcement officers have greater powers to collect money and items from defendants. However, you will have to pay an extra fee to cover their costs if they're not able to collect the debt.</p>
