        How mediation works
      </h1>

      <!--<p>The mediation service will contact you and Mary Richards to arrange an appointment with a mediator.</p>-->

      <h3 class="heading-medium">A mediator phones you</h3>

      <p>If both you and Mary Richards opt in, we'll contact you to arrange a phone call with a mediator.</p>

      <p>The call won't take longer than an hour.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">You discuss the claim</h3>

      <p>The mediator will:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>listen to each side separately - you won’t talk directly to the other side</li>
        <li>ask you to consider what the other side says - they won’t make you compromise</li>
        <li>help you reach an agreement, if possible</li>
      </ul>

      <!--<p>If mediation is successful you'll be asked to sign an agreement to formalise the settlement. If anyone breaks the terms of the agreement the case will go to court.</p>-->

      <h3 class="heading-medium">After the phone call</h3>

      <p>If you agree to settle, we'll ask you to sign a legal agreement that formalises what you agreed.</p>

      <p>If either party breaks the agreement's terms, the other party can apply to the court to enforce them.</p>

      <p>If mediation fails and a hearing is needed, any mediation discussions can't be mentioned in court.
