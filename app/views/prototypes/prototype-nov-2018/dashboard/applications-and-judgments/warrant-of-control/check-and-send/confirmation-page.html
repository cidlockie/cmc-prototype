      <p>When the warrant has been issued, the court will phone Mary Richards and send a letter asking for payment.</p>
      <p>If Mary Richards doesn't pay within 7 days, a bailiff will visit the address you gave within 15 days of the issue of the warrant.</p>
      <p>The bailiff usually visits up to 3 times. If they can't get your money back they'll return the warrant to the court.</p>

      <p>If the defendant pays, the court will send you the money.</p>
