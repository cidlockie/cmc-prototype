      <p>If you don't want to respond and counterclaim on paper, you can either:</p>
      <ul class="list-bullet list">
        <li><a href="../../task-list?counter=NOT-PROCEED">continue your response online with no counterclaim</a></li>
        <li><a href="../../task-list">continue online and pay the counterclaim fee yourself</a></li>

      </ul>

      <p>If you continue your response online, you can't include the counterclaim, but you could make a new claim afterwards. This may mean you pay more in fees.</p>
