  How free mediation works
</h1>

  <h3 class="heading-medium">A mediator phones you</h3>

    <p>We'll contact you to arrange a phone call with a mediator from the Small Claims Mediation Service.</p>

    <p>The call won't take longer than an hour.</p>

  <h3 class="heading-medium">You discuss the claim</h3>

    <p>The mediator will:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>listen to each side separately - you wonâ€™t talk directly to the other side</li>
        <li>ask you to consider what the other side says - they won't make you compromise</li>
        <li>help you reach an agreement, if possible</li>
      </ul>

<h3 class="heading-medium">After the phone call</h3>

  <p>If mediation is successful we'll ask you to sign a legal agreement that formalises what you agreed.</p>

  <p>If either party breaks the terms, the other party can apply to the court to enforce them.</p>

  <p>If mediation fails and a hearing is needed, any mediation discussions can't be mentioned in court.</p>
